# ICO PROJECT

ICO as it's commonly called is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering. This ICO project was created to generate funds for my organization by allowing users buy my token before public launch. Users that have CryptoDevNFT are eligible to claim few tokens for free.

The frontend of this project was built in NextJs while the smart contract was written in Solidity and deployed on Rinkeby testnet.This project makes use of my CryptoDevNFT to be eligible to claim my coin else the user would have to pay to mint the coin.

ICO contract address : `0x745d4599a03D672cEF2887F1D73d50e2790358d5`
